1) Exercise 11.10 (Implement MyStack using inheritance) In Listing 11.10, MyStack is implemented using composition. Define a new stack class that extends ArrayList. Implement MyStack as the UML diagram provided. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter five strings and displays them in reverse order.


2) Exercise Casting: Implement this exercise in the package: myPkg.casting.
